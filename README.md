## Game Rules

Welcome to **Casse-brique**! The objective is to destroy all the bricks using a ball, while preventing the ball from falling out of the screen using a paddle.

### How to Play

- Use the **Left** and **Right arrow keys** on your keyboard to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen.
- Press the **Start** button to begin or restart the game.
- Press the **Stop** button to quit the game.

### Game Rules

1. **Lives:**  
   - You start with 3 lives.
   - You lose a life every time the ball falls below the paddle and out of the screen.
   - If your lives reach zero, the game ends and a "Game Over" message appears.

2. **Bricks:**  
   - Bricks are arranged at the top of the screen.
   - The ball bounces off the paddle, walls, and bricks.
   - When the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears and you gain points.

3. **Winning:**  
   - If you destroy all the bricks, you win! A "Congratulations! You beat the game!" message will appear.

4. **Restarting:**  
   - When you press the Start button after a game over or victory, the game resets: score and lives are set back to their starting values, and all bricks reappear.
